\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We explored a number of different classification techniques for the purpose of classifying events occurring within the large Hadron collider based on kinematic properties of certain particles. Our best classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2\%. Our results also showed that there is practically no difference in accuracy between neural networks and ensemble methods. However, the neural networks outperforms ensemble methods in terms of throughput making it the better choice. But, our results show that a simple tree-based technique could prove to be a reasonable alternative for practical purposes.
