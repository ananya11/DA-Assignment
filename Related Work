This paper provides an analysis of artificial neural networks in  the one of its major application area - forecasting. They provide a summary of current research status of ANN in forecasting and second they provide a guideline of areas for future research . 
It discusses different ways to construct and implement neural networks for forecasting focussing mainly on multi-layer feed forward network. They provide a literature review of papers devoted to comparing ANNs with conventional forecasting approaches.
