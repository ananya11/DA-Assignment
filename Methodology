Description (Give a summary of the method in 1-2 paragraphs)



Feed Forward Network
----------------------- 
Feedforward neural networks consist of a series of layers. The first layer is the connection from the network input. The subsequent layer is a hidden layer which is connected to the input. The subsequent/ final layer is the output layer which produces the network's output. The network model is trained using 'trainscg' network training function which updates weight and bias according to the scaled conjugate gradient method.

The hidden layer contains 70 neurons.  The transfer function used in this layer is 'tansig' (tan-Sigmoid Transfer Function). Tansig is a neural network transfer function which calculates a layer's output from its net input. The output layer produces only 1 output ( 0 or 1). The transfer function used in this layer is 'purelin'. It is a linear transfer function which calculates the final output. 

input data : 29 x 250000
target : 1 x 250000
Train/test split : 80-20


Cascade Forward Network
-----------------------
These are similar to feed-forward networks but includes a connection from the input and every previous layer to following layer. So the output layer here has two inputs : one from the previous hidden layer and the other from the input. The rest of the network is same as that of FeedForwardNetwork. 

input data : 29 x 250000
target : 1 x 250000
Train/test split : 80-20
Size of hidden layer(number of neurons) : 70
Size of output layer : 1
Background: 0 , Signal : 1
